        <h4>Install</h4>
        <p>To install DB4Sci at your site start with the demo install script.
        The demo install script installs the source code to <kbd>/opt/DB4SCI</kbd>
        and creates the administrative database in <kbd>/opt/DB4SCI/admin_db</kbd>.</p>

        <h4>Host and Storage</h4>
        <p>DB4Sci is developed on Ubuntu. Other Linuxes flavors might work but
            have
            not been tested. Build a host system with storage to
            support production databases; memory, core sizes, storage capacity,
            and storage throughput all affect the performance of databases.
            DB4Sci deploys databases to the same host which it runs on. Choose
            your hardware to match the capacity and the performance required
            to run your production databases. 2GB RAM and 8GB disk space is the
            bare minimum to get DB4SCI running.</p>
        <p>Changing from demo mode to production requires configuring the
           software for your site. Demo mode is not secure.  TLS keys and
           Active Directory need to be configured. Use your favorite text
           editor to complete the configuration of DB4Sci. The configuration
           file is located at /opt/DB4SCI/mydb/config.py. You will need to know
           a few things about your local environment to complete the
            configuration.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Database admin accounts. A list of username and passwords for
             administrative access. These accounts are independent of the accounts
             created by users for backups.</li>
            <li>Data Volumes - Path to data volumes which will be used to store
                the database data. More than one volume can be specified. Your
                site can provide users with multiple options for storage based
                on performance and cost. Volumes can be filtered by user and
                database types. For example, use a volume with limited capacity
                for administrative users which is separate from a high-performance
                volume for production databases.</li>
            <li>Active Directoy - A list of domain controllers and your domain name</li>
