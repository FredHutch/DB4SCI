## DB4Sci DataBase For Scienticfic use
DB4SCI is an easy-to-use, web-based, self-service database deployment
application. Users can select a database type and version and DB4SCI creates
a stand-alone database instance for the user. Each deployed database instance
is a separate container with its own private data volumes. Multiple versions
of PostgreSQL, MariaDB, Mongo and Neo4j can be selected. DB4SCI is a fully
containerized Flask application. 

### Web Interface
A very basic Web Interface is provided. To run it you'll need Python 2.7,
Flask and Docker CE.
