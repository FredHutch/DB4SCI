    <h2>DB4SCI Postgres Backups</h2>
      DB4SCI performs full backups every night.  The full backups are sync'd to
      Amazon S3 storage where they are kept for up to six months. The local backups
      are only kept for a few days.

      <h2>User Backup and Recover</h2>
      Users can perform backups for specific tasks like migrations or
      upgrades. Backups can be written to local storage.  We recomend using a scratch 
      file system for storing short term backups. Use a file system that is in
      co-lacated in the save data center that hosts DB4SCI. Saving localy to your
      laptop can be very slow!
      
      <p>The backup examples assume that you are using .pgpass file to store your
      Postgres credentials. No passwords are needed on the command line.
      Use the scratch file system to save a local copy of your database backup. 
      Create a new database/container with DB4SCI to be used for restoring into. 
      The examples utilize the PostgreSQL 
      command line tools. <code>module load PostgreSQL/9.6.1</code>
      
      <p>Create a full backup and save to a local file. <code>
      pg_dump -h mydb -p 320xx -d mydb_admin -U myrootuser -f mydb_backup_today.sql
      </code>
    
      <p>Recover saved backup to a new database.<code>
      psql -h mydb --port=320xx -d recoverdb -U myrootuser -f mydb_backup_today.sql 
      </code>

      <p>Migrate data from one container to another.
      <code>pg_dump -h mydb -p 320xx -d prod_db -U myrootuser | psql  -h mydb --port=320xx -d dev_db -U rootuser</code>

      <p>DB4SCI creates a single Postgres container with a default database 
      which has the same name. Additional databases can
      be created within the Postgres instance. If you want to choose an alternative database 
      name for the recovery; create a new database on the recovery Postgres DB.
      </p>
      <code>psql -h mydb -p 32034 -d db_name -U myrootuser -c "CREATE DATABASE recoverdb;"</code>
      <p>Make a new entry in the .pgpass file for each "database".  To recover 
      from an existing database into the 
      alternative database; just change the connection string.
      </p>
      <code>pg_dump -h mydb -p 320xx -d db_name -U myrootuser | psql -h mydb --port=32034 -d recoverdb -U rootuser</code>
      
      <p>pg_dump will not restore any changes you have made with <kbd>ALTER SYSTEM</kbd>. 
      If you have
      system changes to Postgres you will have to reaplly the changes to the new container.
