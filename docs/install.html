        <h4>Install</h4>
        <p>To install DB4Sci at your site start with the demo install script.
        The demo install script installs the source code to /opt/DB4SCI and 
        creates the administrative database in <kbd>/opt/DB4SCI/admindb</kbd>.</p>
        <h4>Host and Storage</h4>
        <p>DB4Sci is developed on Ubuntu.  Other Linuxes might work but have
           not been tested.  Docker CE and docker-compose need to be
           pre-installed on the host. Build a host system with storage to
           support production databases; memory, core counts, storage capacity,
           and storage throughput all affect the performance of databases.
           DB4Sci deploys databases to the same host which it runs on. Chose
           your hardware to match the capacity and the performance required
           to run your production databases.  </p>
        <p>Changing from demo mode to production requires configuring the
           software for your site. Demo mode is not secure.  TLS keys and
           Active Directory need to be configured. Use your favorite text
           editor to complete the configuration of DB4Sci. The configuration
           file is located at /opt/DB4SCI/mydb/config.py. You will need to know
           how a few things about your local environment. 
        <ul>
            <li>Database admin accounts. A list of username and passwords for
             administrative access. These accounts are independent of the accounts
             created by users for the purpose of backups.
            <li>Data Volumes - Path to data volumes which will be used to store the database data. More than one volume can be specified. Your site can provide users with multiple options for storage based on performance and cost. Volumes can be filtered by user and database types. Example a volume with limited capacity for administrative users which is separate from a high-performance volume for production databases.</li>
            <li>Active Director - A list of domain controllers and your domain name</li>
            <li>AWS credentials and S3 bucket</li>
            <li>ISID of admin users</li>
            <li>Email address for admin alerts</li>
            <li>Email address for Backup admin<li>
            <li>TSL Certs</li>
            <li>TimeZone</li>
